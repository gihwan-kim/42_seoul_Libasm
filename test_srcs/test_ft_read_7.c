Common Instructions
• Your functions should not quit unexpectedly (segmentation fault, bus error, double
free, etc) apart from undefined behaviors. If this happens, your project will be
considered non functional and you will receive a 0 during the evaluation.
• Your Makefile must at least contain the rules $(NAME), all, clean, fclean and
re. And must recompile/relink only necessary files.
• To turn in bonuses to your project, you must include a rule bonus to your Makefile,
which will add all the various headers, librairies or functions that are forbidden on
the main part of the project. Bonuses must be in a different file _bonus.{c/h}.
Mandatory and bonus part evaluation is done separately.
• We encourage you to create test programs for your project even though this work
won’t have to be submitted and won’t be graded. It will give you a chance
to easily test your work and your peers’ work. You will find those tests especially
useful during your defence. Indeed, during defence, you are free to use your tests
and/or the tests of the peer you are evaluating.
• Submit your work to your assigned git repository. Only the work in the git repository will be graded. If Deepthought is assigned to grade your work, it will be done
after your peer-evaluations. If an error happens in any section of your work during
Deepthought’s grading, the evaluation will stop.
• You must write 64 bits ASM. Beware of the "calling convention".
• You can’t do inline ASM, you must do ’.s’ files.
• You must compile your assembly code with nasm.
• You must use the Intel syntax, not the AT&T
